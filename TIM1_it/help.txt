This example shows how to use TIM1 (timer 1) as up-counter with interrupt.

After reset MCU frequency is 2 MHz. 
CPU frequency is divided by prescaler that has value 2000d.
Prescaler value is divided to two separete registers PSCRH(high) and PSCRL(low).
Auto-reload register has value 1000d for interrupting every second.

 MCU_FREQ  / PRESC = TIMER_TICKS_EACH_SECOND
2 000 000d / 2000d =          1000d

TIMER_TICKS / AUTO_REL_REG = NUMBER_OF_INTERRUPTS (PER SECOND)
   1000d    /     1000d    =         1d

Actions that are done on each interrupt by interrupt handler code:
  1. Interrupt flag is reset.
  2. PB5(LED) is inverted.
